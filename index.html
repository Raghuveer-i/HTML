        <h2>CGI Inc., also known as CGI Group Inc., is a Canadian multinational information technology consulting and
            systems integration company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. CGI originally stood for "Conseillers
            en
            gestion et informatique"</h2>

        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">HISTORY</h3>
        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Founding and early years (1970s-1980s)</h4>
        <h5>CGI Inc. was founded as an IT consulting company on June 15, 1976, in Quebec City, Québec, by Serge
            Godin.[3]
            Within several months he was joined by co-founder André Imbeau[8] from Quebec City.[14] They initially ran
            the
            business from Godin's basement with a single phone. Starting with one client,[15] as the company grew in
            size
            the co-founders moved to Montreal,[14] and by the end of their first year they had generated $138,000 in
            revenue.[15] While CGI stands for "Conseillers en gestion et informatique" in French (which translates to
            "consultants in management and information technology" in English), the official English meaning would
            become
            "Consultants to Government and Industry."[8] In later years the company began to go to market as simply CGI.

        <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Markets and corporate structure</h4>
        <h5>CGI has an international client base, with large institutional clients in a wide array of industries and
            markets. The United States made up 29% of their client base as of March 2015, while Canada was the
            second-highest percentage at 15%. The majority of CGI's remaining contracts are in Europe, with 15% in the
            rest
            of the world.</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Products and services</h4>
        <h5>Originally CGI focused its products and services on IT consulting, and the company later branched into
            outsourcing, software development, and systems integration, among other industries.[11] At the end of 2014,
            CGI
            earned 52% of its revenue from providing outsourcing services (specifically through IT services and to a
            lesser
            degree, business process services) and 48% of its revenue from systems integration and consulting.</h5>
